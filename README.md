# Mini_Project
This program is entirely theoretical, the inputs are taken from a .csv file.
This C program implements a simple interactive menu-driven application:
1. It reads a CSV file ("2022worldcup.csv") and allows the user to specify a line number to add the corresponding line to 
   a linked list.
2. The user can also choose to delete a node from the linked list based on its position.
3. The linked list data is printed whenever requested by the user.
4. The program continues executing until the user chooses to exit.
5. Memory allocated for the linked list nodes is appropriately freed upon program termination.
